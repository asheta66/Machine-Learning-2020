# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This is a course on NLP based on the Deep Learning for
Natural Language Processing book by Jason Brownlee

## Part I: Introduction
### Welcome
Welcome to Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing. Natural language processing is the area of study dedicated to the automatic manipulation of speech and text by software. It is an old field of study, originally dominated by rule-based methods designed by linguists, then statistical methods, and, more recently, deep learning methods that show great promise in the field. So much so that the heart of the Google Translate service uses a deep learning method, a topic that you will learn more about in this course.
