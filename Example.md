# Markdown Example

This is a markdown file. Github process the file as html and displays it in a nice way. Formatting markdown is straightforward and code can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## Headings

Under this heading I have a bit of text, under the text I'll have an image from Machine Learning. This image is stored in an /img folder in the root directory of the project. 

The code for an image will look like the following. 

`![alt text](img/image.jpg)`
