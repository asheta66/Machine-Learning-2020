# Markdown Example

This is a markdown file. Github process the file as html and displays it in a nice way. Formatting markdown is straightforward and code can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## Topic

Under this heading I have a bit of text, under the text I'll have an image from Machine Learning. This image is stored in an /img folder in the root directory of the project. 

The code for an image will look like the following. 

`![alt text](img/image.jpg)`

![alt text](img/image.jpg)

Using a combination of text and images slides can be avoided all together and every aspect of the project can be run out of github. 

### SubTopic

Here I have subtopic on the topic. 

## New Topic

All topics and subtopics are indicated by `#` More may be added to decrease the size, such as `##` or `###`. Between the hashmark and the text there should be one space. 

# Closing notes

The Markdown file works well when you want to include direct information for the students to read.
